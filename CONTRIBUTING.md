# Contributing

Looking to contribute something? **Here's how you can help.**

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return,
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing
patches and features.

## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports),
[features requests](#feature-requests) and
[submitting pull requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the
following restrictions:

* You **can** use the issue tracker for personal support requests, but places
  like Stack Overflow and URI's Forum are better places to get help.

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

* Please **do not** open issues or pull requests with solutions to problems
  that I have not yet tried to solve. 

## Bug reports

All projects are submitted to uDebug which tests the solution in several cases.
They are only pushed if they pass all test cases. Bugs are not expected to be
found.

## Alternative solutions

You may suggest or discuss other solutions to a problem if you think the code 
is better or faster.

## Code guidelines

- Always use proper indentation.
- Before committing, review your code style according to Roslyn guidelines.
- Before committing, run Code Analysis in `Debug` configuration and follow the guidelines
  to fix CA issues.
